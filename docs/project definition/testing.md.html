# Calibration and Testing.

The product will be tested by analysis of its sampled data output. 
Using a known signal as input, the dynamic range, CMRR, frequency response, THD and more can be
measured. Acceptable performance will match what is set out in the Engineering
requirements of table [marketReqs].

Part of the reason for beginning this project was the lack of test equipment that could perform
these low frequency, high dynamic range measurements. Oscilloscopes cover the frequency range but do
not have the dynamic range to perform sensitive distortion measurements. Spectrum analyzers often do
have the dynamic range, but do not cover the lowest part of the frequency range. Signal generators
pose another problem, as seen in figure [typLabDist]. Keysight's line of Trueform function generators have a 14 or 16 bit converter,
limiting the noise floor to well above the level of this project. They also claim lower harmonic
distortion, but the published specification of 0.03% is over 100x more than what we wish to
achieve.[^trueform]

So using the lab equipment available, a source can be characterized fully in order to compare
performance across systems. And even if it could, the available signal sources have so much
distortion and noise that measuring the system performance will be impossible.

The second reason for this project is to keep pace with the ever increasing performance of audio
equipment. After looking at the performance of a Focusrite Scarlett 6i6 USB audio interface, it is
determined that this offers very good performance that will allow some of the performance aspects to
at least set some boundaries on performance characteristics. For each measurement, the Focusrite
will be connected with one output into the Iridium ADC and the other back into the Focusrite
interface. The performance can then be compared by examining our systems output with the Focusrite.
The data from the Focusrite will be taken using ARTA spectrum analyzer mode. Using this setup allows
us to estimate the performance of the system's distortion levels including THD and IMD.

Many additional characteristics may be made without the need of a low distortion source and may be
made with other equipment as stated.

## Calibration.

Before any measurements can be made, the systems magnitude must be calibrated.
Because of the uncertainty of the exact reference voltage and circuit gain, a scale factor is found
by sending a known signal into the input and reading the resulting signal in the Iridium interface.
The input signal is measured using an Agilent 34661A multimeter to create a histogram of the signal
and find a very accurate average level. This is compared against the RMS readout in the GUI which is
calculated using the time domain sampled data. Because many measurements use a -3 dB input signal.
The system is calibrated near this level. The Focusrite interface is used as signal generator for
this test to produce a balanced signal input.

| Input Signal | System Measurement | Scale Factor |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ------------ |
| 0.7072412 V  | 0.0837775          | 8.44190 V    |
[Table [scaleFactor]: Data and results of calculating scale factor]

This value is inserted into the code to scale the data correctly.

## Frequency Response and bandwidth.

For frequency response measurements, a Rigol DS1062Z function generator is used to create a white
noise source. The response is viewed in the frequency domain with no window, maximum number of
samples, and frequency domain averaging on with 100 samples averaged. The resulting plots for each
sample rate are shown in figure [measureFreqResp]. The minimum frequency domain measureable frequency and
the estimated -3dB maximum frequency are listed in table [freqRespTable].

of highest, middle, and lowest sample rates](Images/measureFreqResponse.png)

| Sample Rate [kSPS] | Min Freq [Hz] | Max Freq [kHz] |
| ------------------ | ------------- | -------------- |
| 312.5              | 19.07         | 133            |
| 156.25             | 9.54          | 68             |
| 78.125             | 4.77          | 33             |
[Table [freqRespTable]: Summary of frequency response measurements]


## Noise.

To measure noise, the input should be terminated with a resistor similar to the expected source
impedance. After connecting the resistor, the RMS signal level and the voltage noise density can be
measured in the time and frequency domain respectively. The RMS noise is measured at maximum
bandwidth, and no window is used in the frequency domain.

| Resistor  | RMS noise voltage | Voltage noise density |
| --------  | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| 47.0 ohms | 24.03 uV          | -127.70 dB at 1 kHz   |

## CMRR.

Common mode rejection ratio is determined by sending a known signal into both of the differential
inputs and measuring the signal that makes it through the system. The ratio of these is computed and
converted to dB:

$$ CMRR = 20\log\left(\frac{measured}{input}\right) $$

A setup similar to the calibration system is used here, but the Rigol DS1062Z is used as signal
source for its extended bandwidth. CMRR can vary with frequency, so it is checked for several
different frequencies. The measured level is taken from the RMS display in the GUI while the INput
level is measured with the Agilent 34661A multimeter.


| Frequency | Input level [V] | Measured level [uV] | CMRR [dB] |
| --------- | -----------     | --------------      | ----      |
| 100 Hz    | 0.707362        | 72.52977            | 79.78     |
| 1 kHz     | 0.707215        | 21.17327            | 90.48     |
| 100 kHz   | 0.706289        | 287.713             | 67.80     |
[Table [CMRR]: Common mode rejection ratio at several frequencies.]

## Dynamic Range.

The dynamic range of a system is the ratio of maximum signal input relative to the minimum signal,
expressed in decibels. Typically this is compared to the noise floor. In the time domain the dynamic
range is given by the maximum input level over the RMS noise level. However in frequency domain,
this becomes the maximum signal level over the noise density. Since noise density is always lower
than the RMS noise, dynamic range is higher in the frequency domain than the time domain.

The maximum signal input is estimated by measuring the peak amplitude for a clipped signal input and
dividing by $ \sqrt{2} $. This gives the theoretical maximum RMS value of the signal input. This is
then divided by the RMS noise for time domain dynamic range and by the voltage noise density for
frequency domain dynamic range found in table [noisePerformance]. The final dynamic range is
expressed in decibels.

| Maximum Signal | Est Max RMS | DR in time domain | DR in frequency domain |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| 6.01 V         | 4.25 V      | 105.0 dB          | 140.3 dB               |
[Table [dynamicRange]: Data and results of determining dynamic range. The lower limits used for calculation is the  same as in table [noisePerformance].]

## Distortion.

Total harmonic distortion is most often specified for a 1 kHz -3dB signal level. Distortion can
change with frequency and input level, so for a better understanding of the system, measurements are
made at -3 and +6dB, and at 1 and 10 kHz.

The Focusrite is used as signal generator here and the THD display in ARTA is used to establish a
boundary on distortion performance. It is important to note that the ARTA measurement will be
including distortion in both the output and input of the Focusrite interface, while the signal
feeding the Iridium ADC will be the distortion of the Focusrite's output and the distortion of the
Iridium system itself. This may introduce some error into the measurement and is the reason this
section can only set bounds on the distortion level and not precisely state the distortion itself.

Total harmonic distortion is calculated by finding the ratio of power in the upper harmonics to the
power in the main harmonic. The square root of this is taken, and the value is usually expressed as
a percentage.

$ THD = 100 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{n=2}^\inf{H_n^2}}{H_1^2}} $

Where $ H_n $ refers to the harmonic of the signal input. 

To calculate distortion, a quick python script is used. The fundamental is measured from the
frequency domain plot and input to the script, and the measurable harmonics are input as a list of
values. All measurements can be input in dB and are converted to linear units for calculation.

```python
'''Calculate harmonic distortion as a percent 
using dB magnitude values from spectrum analyzer.'''

# fundamental level in dB.
fundamental = -3.2096

# list of higher harmonic levels in dB.
harmonics = [-121.58, -124.35, -124.55, -123.9, -127.23]

harmonic_power = sum([10**(peak/10) for peak in harmonics])
fundamental_power = 10**(fundamental/10)

distortion = (harmonic_power / fundamental_power)**0.5

# Print distortion as a percent..
print(f'Distortion: {distortion*100:.4}%')

```

| Frequency | input magnitude | Measured THD [%] | Loopback THD [%] |
| --------- | --------------- | ------------     | ------------     |
| 1 kHz     | -3 dB           | 0.0002051        | 0.0048           |
| 10 kHz    | -3 dB           | 0.0003415        | 0.0018           |
| 1 kHz     | +6 dB           | 0.003334         | 0.0017           |
| 10 kHz    | +6 dB           | 0.003509         | 0.0054           |
[Table [distortionResults]: Results of distortion test, Measured THD is the distortion calculated from Iridium ADC measurements, Loopback THD is the distortion of the Focusrite interface in loopback connection as measured by ARTA.]

In most cases the distortion measured by Iridium ADC is lower than with the Focusrite interface.
Even better equipment is required to characterize the system to a high degree of accuracy.  The one
exception is at 1 kHz with a +6 dB which displays noticeably different distortion, indicating that
further investigation into the cause of this may be required.
