# Overview of the Need.

## Product Description.

The Iridium ADC has a very low noise, high dynamic range input. 
The stable, calibrated reference voltage makes it suitable for measurement of absolute (instead of relative) signal levels. 
It features a bandwidth greatly in excess of existing audio measurement solutions. 
The companion software displays the signal simultaneously in the time and frequency domain. All of this makes it a unique test and measurement system that fills a space not satisfied by most existing equipment.

## Product Technology/Market Research.
For audio analysis the current market leader is Audio Precision. 
Their audio measurement systems are the industry standard for professional audio companies.
But their equipment carries with it a heavy price tag, reaching into the thousands or tens of thousands of dollars.
Common lab equipment for electrical engineering can not be used either, oscilloscopes sacrifice sensitivity for bandwidth.
Most oscilloscopes on the market offer 8 bit converters, and suffer from a correspondingly large noise floor (Theoretical limit for 8 bit is only 50 dB of dynamic range).
Even the new wave of "high resolution" oscilloscopes, such as the LeCroy HRO series only offer 12 bit conversion, unable to even measure the aging CD standard of 16 bit audio.
Additionally, oscilloscopes are not designed for measurements like distortion that are ideally suited to the frequency domain.

Many scientific pursuits also require characterizing high dynamic range broadband signals. Mechanical resonance, vibration modes, biological signaling, and ultrasonic inspection are all fields that could benefit from having a measurement device such as this.
The range of signal inputs that can be taken without adjustment of any front end or external amplifier could make the Iridium ADC useful for production line QA or signal integrity verification.
