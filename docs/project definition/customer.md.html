# Customer Archetype.
The Iridium ADC is a tool that allows engineers, product developers, and researchers to obtain and process the data that they need to. The user of this device may fit into several categories.

**Specialty audio companies.**

The market for specialty audio companies has been expanding. Increasingly, independent companies like Schitt audio are becoming the choice for home audio enthusiasts. Guitar effect pedals has seen an explosion in the number of companies developing and (successfully) selling pedals that take on all sorts of mixtures of digital and analog processing. Driven by the presence of mobile audio devices courtesy of our phones, a resurgence in popularity of high end headphones has spurred a market devoted to headphone amplifiers.

Many of these companies have product lines developed by just one or two engineers on a tight budget. Many probably develop entirely by ear because there are no currently available solutions for audio measurement under the cost of one thousand dollars. By providing a much larger bandwidth than typical audio analysis devices, The Iridium is able to investigate the characteristics of switch mode power supply noise, out-of-band distortion products, EMI pickup, self oscillation, and other signals that would not be shown on most of the low end targeted audio analyzers. By making the tools available, the Iridium ADC allows these engineers the tools to close the feedback path on these devices, reduce development time, improving the performance, and accurately report technical specifications.

**Scientific Research**

The Iridium ADC can function as a multi use data acquisition system. There are many signals similar to audio present in natural phenomenon and useful in scientific or industrial research. The ability to measure signals of a few micro volts and of a several volts simultaneously can open up the ability of a researcher to collect data and perform the cleanup and filtering in the digital domain. The bandwidth allows for research into both ultrasonic and subsonic bands. Accurately and confidently measure signals that could not be captured on most traditional lab equipment.

## Pains and Gains
One of the major problems with current solutions is the cost. 
Audio Precision's introductory audio analyzer, the APx515, starts at over $6000 [^apcost]. 
Additionally, this unit has a bandwidth of only 90 kHz. 
By offering our unit at a lower price point, there is a great potential to increase the number of people who can perform this testing. 
That means better designs and faster development. 

The features of the Iridium ADC also can help during product development. 
The wide bandwidth means fewer problems will be missed and the high dynamic range means huge swings in signal amplitude can be measured without changing the test setup.

## Competitors

The market for audio analyzers is small but there are several companies.

**Audio Precision:**
The market leader in audio measurement, Their devices lead the pack in performance and types of measurement. 
They offer analyzers from the 2 channel APx515 to the modular multichannel APx586 with 16 input channels. 
Their flagship offers a residual THD+N of -117dB +1.0 uV. 
That's a maximum of 0.00024% over a bandwidth of 1 MHz! 
Audio Precision is almost always likely to dominate the competition on performance and testing standards, but they also carry a hefty price tag.

**Prism Sound:** 
Makers of the dScope audio analyzer, this offers the 90 kHz bandwidth with THD+N as low as 0.00040% [^dScope]. 
An article from 2008 claimed they were slashing prices by 24% to $9,850 [^prismCost]. 
This appears to offer similar testing capability to some of the Audio Precision line, but is starting to show its age technologically:
It advertises automation using ActiveX, a technology now being shunned by its creator, Microsoft.

**Avermetrics:**
A newer company, Avermetrics was founded in 2011 [^averFound]. 
The AverLAB is relatively low cost, portable, desktop audio analyzer released in August 2017.
It is available on Amazon for a cost of $3000, has a bandwidth from 10 Hz to 88 kHz and a THD+N of 0.00032%. It features a unique ethernet interface instead of USB and a compact, fanless design [^averlab]. 
The AverLAB is the nearest competitor to the Iridium ADC. 
The AverLAB contains more features, but the Iridium ADC is targeting better performance.
