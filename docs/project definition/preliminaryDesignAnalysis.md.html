# Preliminary Design Analysis.
<!-- Include picture and 3d Model render -->
## Physical Design.

The enclosure is designed to be rugged and durable. 
It should be metal for shielding and heat sinking purposes.
The 3D Model seen in figure [3dmodel] shows off the concept.
It should be a low profile unit, around 8" x 10" x 2", making it on the small side of lab equipment.
The prototypes will likely use an extruded aluminum style enclosure.

## Electrical Design.

The analog portions of the design will be based around a selection of low noise op amps and difference amps.
Choice of an ADC is critical to meeting design criteria. 
In this frequency range, delta sigma type converters are unbeatable for their inherent linearity and distortion.
The oversampling of delta sigma converters also has the benefit of relaxing anti aliasing filter requirements. 
Bit depth of the ADC should be picked to maximize the use of available dynamic range. 
This will likely be limited by the predicted noise coming out of the analog stages. 
It is expected that the effective number of bits will be in the 18-20 bit range.
The performance of the ADC is dependent on having a stable, noise free voltage reference as any 

The system must have a digital controller to correctly setup the ADC and USB bridge. 
Because we are dealing with data words up to 24 bits, a 32 bit controller is a natural choice.
ARM Cortex M4 microcontrollers have clock speeds of 50 MHz or higher and even include DSP instructions [^NXPK20].
The USB Bridge handles the final transfer of information to and from the computer.
It must be capable of at least USB 2.0 high speed for a data rate of up to 480 Mbps. 
A 24 bit data word at 1 MSPS will use at least 24Mbps per channel, requiring this faster USB standard.

Finally, the power supply must be able to generate the required voltages without introducing noise into the sensitive circuitry.
Ideally a toroidal transformer will be used for their better EMI performance, 
and a separately shielded chamber within the unit could provide even more isolation.
