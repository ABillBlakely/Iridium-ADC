# Overview of the Need.

## Product Description.

The core of the Iridium ADC is a high dynamic range, low distortion data acquisition system. A
stable reference voltage makes it suitable for measurement of absolute (instead of relative) signal
levels. It features a bandwidth much larger than most audio measurement solutions. 
The resulting hardware is a compact unit only 3.3" by 2.8". Three external connections
are required: a power input, a USB cable, and a connection to the signal that is being measured.

The companion software, seen in figure [GUI] displays the signal in the time and frequency domain. Through the GUI, the
user can control the sampling rate, number of samples, number of averages, and windowing function.
Simultaneous display of time and frequency domain allows for an immediate investigation of any
unexpected artifacts. The plots allow for interactive zooming, data collection, annotation, and data
export. All of this makes it a powerful test and measurement system that fills a space not satisfied
by most existing equipment.


## Product Technology/Market Research. 

For audio analysis the current market leader is Audio Precision. Their audio measurement systems are
the industry standard for professional audio companies but carry a heavy price tag, reaching into
the thousands or tens of thousands of dollars.

Common lab equipment for electrical engineering is not suitable for many audio measurements either.
Oscilloscopes sacrifice sensitivity for bandwidth, with most oscilloscopes on the market offering 8
bit converters. This causes a correspondingly large noise floor as the theoretical limit for 8 bit systems
is only 50 dB of dynamic range. Even the new wave of "high resolution" oscilloscopes, such as the
LeCroy HRO series, only offer 12 bit conversion [^lecroyHR1O]. This would be unable to characterize
even the aging CD standard of 16 bit audio. Additionally, oscilloscopes are first and foremost time
domain systems and are not designed for measurements like distortion that are ideally suited to the
frequency domain.

Many scientific pursuits also require characterizing high dynamic range broadband signals.
Mechanical resonance, vibration modes, biological signaling, and ultrasonic inspection are all
fields that could benefit from having a measurement device such as this. The wide range of signal
magnitude and frequency  that can be measured without adjustment of any front end filter or
amplifier could make the Iridium ADC useful for scientific measurement, production line QA, or
signal integrity verification.
