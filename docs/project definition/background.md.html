# Background.
High quality audio is a field full of interesting challenges. 
Audio reproduction involves maintaining a flat response across a minimum three decades of bandwidth. 
Additionally, human hearing has an incredibly broad dynamic range, with the ability to discern quiet whispers and roaring jet engines.
Because these devices are hooked into a chain serially, and each device adds it's own noise, the signal to noise ratio must exceed that of our hearing. 
It is not uncommon for consumer devices to claim SNR of over 110dB [^APfundamentals], a range from 1 V down to about 70 nV.
When designing and building these devices very sensitive, stable, and transparent measurement equipment must be used.

<!-- TODO: Update this section with real data -->
The Iridium ADC fits these needs and more by supplying a high quality converter with a bandwidth greatly in excess of what is normally required for audio and a dynamic range of over 110 dB. 
This allows an engineer to perform tests that they can not do with ordinary systems, and allows the Iridium ADC to be used for measurement in other engineering and scientific fields.

Many audio quality measurements are performed in the frequency domain, and the first step in that analysis is to convert the analog signal to a digital one. Metrics such as frequency response, signal-to-noise ratio, and, as seen in figure [THD], harmonic distortion are often easier to perform in the frequency domain. However, to accurately characterize an analog system using these digital tools, an accurate and precise ADC must be used.

What makes an ADC precise and accurate? ADC's have several key qualities. Bit depth determines the number of signal magnitude levels that are available. Since the lowest noise floor that can be achieved is equal to one bit of conversion, this also sets the theoretical dynamic range. A 24 bit converter has a theoretical dynamic range of $20\log(2^{24}) = 144 dB$. 
The sample rate determines the maximum frequency that can be accurately measured. There are several types of analog to digital conversion, but in this frequency range delta sigma converters dominate. These currently have an upper frequency limit of a few MHz, but offer very good linearity. In general, ADC's have two types of nonlinearities, integral non-linearity (INL), and differential non-linearity (DNL) as seen in figure [NL].[^AoE]

INL determines the maximum deviation from a straight line over all conversion levels while DNL determines the maximum step change from each level to adjacent levels. Delta sigma converters are guaranteed monotonic for less than 1 bit DNL. Delta-sigma converters also feature very low INL with 3 ppm typical.
