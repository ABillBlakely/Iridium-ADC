# Overview of the Need.

## Product Description.

The Iridium ADC has two extremely low noise balanced input channels. 
The stable, calibrated reference voltage makes it suitable for measurement of absolute (instead of relative) signal levels. 
It features a bandwidth greatly in excess of existing audio measurement solutions. 
The data is transferred over USB to a computer where it identifies itself as a USB Audio Class Device. 
This makes it easy to process and analyze the data using an array of already available tools. 
The Iridium ADC allows for very sensitive measurement with minimal setup and at a lower cost.

## Product Technology/Market Research.
For audio analysis the current market leader is Audio Precision. 
Their audio measurement systems are the industry standard for professional audio companies.
But their equipment carries with it a heavy price tag, reaching into the thousands or tens of thousands of dollars.
Common lab equipment for electrical engineering can not be used either, oscilloscopes sacrifice sensitivity for bandwidth.
Most oscilloscopes on the market offer 8 bit converters, and suffer from a correspondingly large noise floor.
Even the best high resolution oscilloscopes only offer 12 bit conversion, unable to even measure the aged CD standard of 16 bit audio.
Additionally, oscilloscopes are not designed for measurements like distortion that are ideally suited to the frequency domain.

Many scientific pursuits also require characterizing high dynamic range broadband signals. Mechanical resonance, vibration modes, biological signaling, and ultrasonic inspection are all fields that could benefit from having a measurement device such as this.
The range of signal inputs that can be taken without adjustment of any front end or external amplifier makes the Iridium ADC useful for production line QA or signal integrity verification.
Currently there is no available device that combines this level of dynamic range with this range of bandwidth.
