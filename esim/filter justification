Filter design logic.

Delta sigma modulators oversample the input signal. The nyquist rate is based on this oversampling.

The AK55X8 will be running at a sample clock of 36.864 MHz placing the nyquist rate at 18.432 MHz.

We need -120 db of attenuation. This can also tolerate folding of the signal most of the way back to the actual signal bandwidth.

So actual bandwidth to stop band is
BW = (18.432Mhz - 400kHz) * 2

so attenuation band width is
log10(36.864E6 / 400E3) = 1.96 decades

we want 120 dB attenuation at the end so the filter order is

120 / (20 * 1.96) = 3.05

so maybe use a 4th order filter.
