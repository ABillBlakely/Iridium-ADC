# Marketing Requirements.

The customers for the Iridium ADC need the device to be high performance, reliable, robust, and accurate. 
These manifest as a system with balanced inputs, low noise, high bandwidth, and with a stable reference. 
Because most of the functionality comes through the software, it will be important to develop that side of the business and create robust, feature rich software.
For ease and flexibility of use, the unit should be compact and self-contained and provide the most common input types. 
The ideal form factor would be similar to many audio interfaces and the Audio Precision line of analyzers, such as those in Figure [interfaces].

![Figure [interfaces]: A consumer audio interface from Focusrite and a professional Audio Analyzer from Audio Precision](Images/interfaces.jpg)

To a large extent, we are trying to create a new customer with this product. 
Audio analyzers are actually very sensitive data acquisition devices, and in today's world, data is everything. 
It is important to develop and push the general purpose aspects of the device as well as the specific target market. 
With the right software capabilities, this could be a much more flexible instrument for viewing low frequency signals than an oscilloscope is. 

Specific marketing requirements are listed in table [marketReqs].

## Marketing and Engineering Requirements.

| Importance   | Marketing Requirement             | Engineering Requirement                               | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------   | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| High         | Low noise                         | Noise floor < -110dB with 50 ohm input termination.   | Low Self noise preserves as much of the available dynamic range as possible. This enables measurement of signal than span from a few micro volts to several volts.                                             |
| High         | High bandwidth                    | +/- 1 dB from 10Hz to 300 kHz.                        | Bandwidth allows for measurement of signal and products that are beyond the scope of other signal analyzers including ultrasonic and switch mode power supplies.                                               |
| High         | Low Distortion                    | THD < 0.001%                                          | Attempting to measure device that have very low distortion requires a measurement unit with even lower distortion.                                                                                             |
| High         | Stable, known reference           | 5V +/- 0.01% 25ppm temp co, low drift.                | This allows for confidently transforming the relative measurement of decibel-full scale into an absolute voltage level. This is a large part of what separates this from the available consumer level devices. |
| High         | Balanced inputs                   | CMRR > 60 dB.                                         | Essential for eliminating noise pickup from sources with very low output levels. Professional audio systems are nearly always differential.                                                                    |
| Medium       | Common/generic power supply       | DC power supply, 5mm barrel connector.                | Simplifies the setup and operation of the device and does not tie up a lab supply which may be required for the device under test.                                                                             |

## Testing and Verification.

The product will be tested by performing frequency domain analysis on its digital output using software such as ARTA. 
Using a low distortion signal input, the SNR, THD, and THD+N can be measured. 
With two sine waves input, the IMD may be measured. 
Using a noise source, the frequency response can be measured.
Acceptable performance will match what is set out in the Engineering requirements of table [marketReqs].
