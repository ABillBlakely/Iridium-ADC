## Appendix A: Analysis of Senior Project.

<!-- Include Ethics section. -->
Project Title: Iridium ADC

Studentâ€™s Name: Bill Blakely

### Summary of Functional Requirements.

 <!-- Describe the overall capabilities or functions of your
project or design. Describe what your project does. (Do not describe how you designed it). --> 

This project is intended to be used for scientific and engineering measurement of highly dynamic
signals.  It features a differential input that is sampled with a precision ADC. The digital data is
then sent to a computer over a USB connection where it is processed and displayed by a companion
program. The PC based program allows the user to view the signal in time and frequency domain
simultaneously. It also provides control over the sample rate, sample length, windowing function,
and frequency domain magnitude averaging.


### Primary Constraints. 

<!-- Describe significant challenges or difficulties associated with your project or implementation. For example, what were limiting factors, or other issues that impacted your approach? What made your project difficult? What parameters or specifications limited your options or directed your approach? -->

This device is intended to be a very high performance device in regard to noise and distortion.
Extreme care must be taken to preserve as much of the linearity and dynamic range as possible.
Digitally, high-resolution, high-bandwidth signals result in a large number of bits.  The digital
controller and USB bridge must be specified and correctly implemented to handle the amount of data
that is expected to be pushed through the channel. The user mode program must be intuitive and easy
to use.


### Economics.

#### Impacts.

**Human Capital:**  
This device is intended to fit into the relatively low volume market of professional test equipment.
This creates the potential for jobs in development and manufacturing, as well as in support.  The
device seeks to increase the level of frequency domain analysis done in the space of low frequency
signals, and therefore increases the knowledge and capability of engineers and researchers all
around the world.

**Financial Capital:**
Initial development is to be self-funded. Moving beyond the prototyping stage will require seeking
out partners, investors, and venture capitalists willing to fund the project.

**Manufactured or Real Capital:**
Serious development of this project into a company will require investment to acquire a suitable
suite of test and measurement equipment.  It will also require that the manufacturing facilities and
office space are acquired.

**Natural Capital:**
The device has similar environmental impact to much other lab equipment such as bench multimeters.
Effort to reduce the natural capital can be made such as use of lead-free parts and sustainable
energy used in office and manufacturing facilities. The display-less design and power management
help to reduce the power consumption of the device.  The best way to prevent wasted natural capital
in this device is to create a robust, dependable product that will not need to be replaced due to
performance limitations or breakage.

#### Cost and Benefits.

During prototype development stage, by far the largest associated cost is time.  Large amounts of
time must be put into the research of the techniques and methods of high performance analog design,
parts selection, code development, careful PCB layout, and more.  The only significant capital
expense is in the parts and PCB manufacture, no additional special equipment is required for
development of the prototype.

The total BOM cost comes to 175.34

A condensed version of the BOM is presented in table [condensedBOM].

| Part                        | Approximate Cost ($) |
| --------------------------- | -------------------- |
| ADC                         | 57                   |
| Microcontroller dev board   | 15                   |
| Precision op amps           | 20                   |
| Power Supply and reference  | 20                   |
| Connectors                  | 12                   |
| Passives (est. avg. cost)   | 38                   |
| PCB                         | 15                   |

### Manufacturing.

Initial estimated volume is expected to be low. The value to customers is high and this will justify
a retail price of around 5x the BOM cost. Using the lower cost estimate from table [condensedBOM] this
will result in a retail price of around $900.  With a direct sales model and estimated first year
volume of 100 units, this is a yearly revenue of $72,500. 

### Environmental.

Environmentally friendly products start in the design phase.  This device is designed to be durable
and should not need to be replaced for a long time.  Additional environmental impact reduction will
be had by seeking out environmentally friendly manufacturers.  Reputable PCB vendors that are
careful with the hazardous chemicals used in production.  Ideally, we would use a manufacturing
plant that makes use of sustainable energy sources to power their facilities.

### Manufacturability.

Units have several things that make manufacturing challenging.  Each unit is expected to be tested
and calibrated individually to assure high accuracy, precision, and performance. Aside from this,
there is little that is especially challenging about the device.  It reduces to PCB assemblies in a
box, which is something that manufacturers have gotten very good at doing.  While a custom enclosure
may be desired, it is not critical to the function, so that the only actually unique part of the
unit is the PCB assembly.


### Sustainability.

The product is designed to have a long lifetime.  The anticipated support issues if produced are
repairs and recalibration.  The core performance of the hardware currently exceeds the performance
of the software, so it is possible that units can be software upgradeable to unlock additional
performance. This can extend the product lifetime therefore saving natural resources.

### Ethical. 

There is an ethical obligation to design and manufacture a device that does not incorporate planned
obsolescence.  It must also be designed for safe operation, especially the power supply.  Perhaps
most critically  for this device is to publish the performance specifications as honestly and
completely as possible.

### Health and Safety. 

The device poses little direct health risk. There are no dangerous voltages present or moving
mechanical parts. The indirect health dangers are byproducts of manufacturing. Use of lead free
solder and environmentally friendly manufacturing processes are important to minimize the long term
impact of any electronic device. 

### Social and Political. 

The audio market has a long history of rejecting measurement and characterization. To some extent,
this is changing. Most purchasing is done online and because devices can not be heard as beforehand,
people have turned to test data to inform their purchasing decisions. Currently small audio
companies do not have a cost effective way to accurately characterize their devices. This has the
potential to influence the way that audio companies publish their performance characterization
tests.

### Development.

Development of this project utilized a diverse skillset. The project mixed high performance analog,
embedded system design, and a PC application together into one project. This required filter design,
noise analysis,  schematic capture, PCB layout, C++ and python development, as well as an
understanding of the FFT and frequency domain analysis. This tied together many separate interests
into one comprehensive package. The steepest learning curve was in the PCB layout. The ADC package,
a 64 pin QFP, 0.5 mm pin pitch, and exposed paddle proved to be quite a challenge to layout and
assemble. In a new design, moving to a four layer PCB, not routing any traces underneath the
package, and using wider traces and spacing would be highly recommended.
