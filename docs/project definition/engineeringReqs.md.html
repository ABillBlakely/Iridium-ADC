# Requirements and specifications.

The products requirements and targeted specifications are estimated in this section. 

## Marketing and Engineering Requirements.

Marketing requirements in table [marketReqs] describe what is considered necessary to the project.
The engineering specifications attempt to set defined guidelines for the project.

| Importance   | Marketing Requirement           | Engineering Requirement                                   | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------     | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            |
| High         | Low noise                       | Noise floor < -110dB @ 1kHz with 50 ohm input termination.       | Low self noise preserves as much of the available dynamic range as possible. This enables measurement of signal than span from a few micro volts to several volts.                                                                                                         |
| High         | High bandwidth                  | +/- 1 dB from 10Hz to 130 kHz.                            | Bandwidth allows for measurement of signal and products that are beyond the scope of other signal analyzers. These signal include ultrasonics and switch mode power supply noise.                                                                                          |
| High         | Low Distortion                  | THD < 0.001%                                              | Attempting to measure device that have very low distortion requires a measurement unit with even lower distortion.                                                                                                                                                         |
| High         | Stable, known reference         | 4.096 +/- 0.05%, 3 ppm temp co, 40 ppm longterm stability | This allows for confidently transforming the relative measurement of decibel-full scale into an absolute voltage level that will not change significantly with environment or time. This is a large part of what separates this from the available consumer level devices. |
| High         | Balanced inputs                 | CMRR > 60 dB.                                             | Essential for eliminating noise pickup from sources with very low output levels. Professional audio systems are nearly always differential.                                                                                                                                |
| Medium       | Common/generic power supply     | DC power supply, 5mm barrel connector.                    | Simplifies the setup and operation of the device and does not tie up a lab supply which may be required for the device under test.                                                                                                                                         |
| Medium       | GUI                             | Display of data and selection of parameters.              | Most of the characterization happens in the GUI, control from this enables easy measurement setup. Data could just be logged to a file and analyzed in another program.                                                                                                    |

## Block Diagram and Specifications.

The Level 0 block diagram of the physical unit is seen in figure [L0]. The signal input is specified
as a differential input, although it may be used with unbalanced signals as well. The USB connection
serves dual purpose as a way to get the data out and to receive control signals.

| Block                  | Description                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   |
| Differential Input     | Maximum 10 V differential. Extremely low noise and distortion.                                                                                    |
| Anti Aliasing Filter   | Cut-off frequency will be determined by bandwidth of final ADC.                                                                                   |
| ADC                    | >20 bit to use all of the potential dynamic range. Delta-Sigma converters offer the best linearity and noise performance in this frequency range. |
| Controller             | Responsible for setting up the digital devices and preparing data for USB transfer. Must be fast enough to handle stream of data from ADC.        |
| USB Bridge             | Communication with host computer, 24 bit samples at 100's of kSPS result in a lot of data which requires a fairly high bandwidth to transmit.                                                                                                             |
| Voltage Reference      | Low Drift, Low Temp co. reference.                                                                                                                |
| LDO Regulators         | Must generate low noise 12 V supply for input stage as well as 5V and 2.5V sources for the ADC.                                                   |
