# Customer Archetype.

The Iridium ADC is a tool that allows engineers, product developers, and researchers to obtain and
process the data that they need to. The user of this device may fit into several categories.

**Specialty audio companies.** The market for specialty audio companies has been expanding. Increasingly, independent companies are
becoming the choice for home audio enthusiasts. Guitar effect pedals have seen an explosion in the
number of companies developing and selling pedals that take on all sorts of mixtures
of digital and analog processing. A resurgence in popularity of high end headphones has spurred a
market devoted to headphone amplifiers to buffer the mobile audio devices we all have in our phones.

Many of these companies have product lines developed by just one or two engineers on a tight budget.
Some probably develop their product entirely by ear because there are no currently available
solutions for audio measurement under the cost of several thousand dollars. By providing a much
larger bandwidth than typical audio analysis devices, the Iridium ADC is able to investigate the
characteristics of switch mode power supply noise, out-of-band distortion products, EMI pickup, self
oscillation, and other signals that would not be shown on most of the low cost options for audio
analysis. By making the tools available, the Iridium ADC provides these engineers the tools to close
the development feedback path on these devices, reducing development time, improving the
performance, and producing accurate technical specifications.

**Scientific Research** The Iridium ADC can function as a multi-use data acquisition system. There are many signals similar
to audio present in natural phenomenon or that are useful in scientific or industrial research. The
ability to measure signals of a few micro volts and of a several volts simultaneously can open up
the ability of a researcher to collect data and perform the cleanup and filtering in the digital
domain. The bandwidth allows for research into both ultrasonic and subsonic bands. Accurately and
confidently measure signals that could not be captured on most traditional lab equipment.

## Pains and Gains.

One of the major problems with current solutions is the cost. Audio Precision's
introductory audio analyzer, the APx515, starts at over $6000 [^apcost]. Additionally, this unit
has a bandwidth of only 90 kHz. By offering our unit at a lower price point, there is a great
potential to increase the number of people who can perform this testing. That means better designs
and faster development.

The features of the Iridium ADC also can help during product development. The wide bandwidth means
fewer problems will be missed and the high dynamic range means huge swings in signal amplitude can
be measured without changing the test setup. There is far less setup and configuration when using
this system, allowing an engineer to do more work with less hassle. 

## Competitors.

**Audio Precision:**  The market leader in audio measurement, their devices lead the pack in
performance and types of measurement. They offer analyzers from the 2 channel APx515 to the modular
multichannel APx586 with 16 input channels. Their flagship offers a residual THD+N of -117dB +1.0
uV. That's a maximum of 0.00024% over a bandwidth of 1 MHz! Audio Precision is almost always likely
to dominate the competition on performance and testing standards, but they also carry a hefty price
tag.

**Prism Sound:** 
Makers of the dScope audio analyzer, this offers the 90 kHz bandwidth with THD+N as low as 0.00040%
[^dScope]. An article from 2008 claimed they were slashing prices by 24% to $9,850 [^prismCost].
This appears to offer similar testing capability to some of the Audio Precision line but is
starting to show its age technologically: it advertises automation using ActiveX, a technology now
being shunned even by its creator, Microsoft.

**Avermetrics:**
A newer company, Avermetrics was founded in 2011 [^averFound]. The AverLAB is a relatively low cost,
portable desktop audio analyzer released in August 2017. It is available on Amazon for a cost of
$3000, has a bandwidth from 10 Hz to 88 kHz and a THD+N of 0.00032%. It features a unique ethernet
interface instead of USB and a compact, fanless design [^averlab]. The AverLAB is the nearest
competitor to the Iridium ADC. The AverLAB contains more features, but the Iridium ADC is targeting
expanded performance.
