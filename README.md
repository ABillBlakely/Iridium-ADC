# Iridium-ADC
High performance ADC for audio analysis and scientific measurement.

I recommend that you check out the full design document at [docs/Iridium ADC final.pdf](docs/Iridium%20ADC%20final.pdf). 

That very large document contains schematics, gerbers, BOMs, performance metrics, motivations, and analysis.

## Repository
This repository is organized by folder structure.

* docs: contains reports and analyses for the project.
* hardware: contains models and information about the physical structure of the project.
* ecad: contains the ecad files including schematic and PCB designs.
* esim: contains electronic simulation files.
* src: source files for STM32F446RE microcontroller.
